# et’s create some text-based art using nested loops! Here’s the idea:

# You’ll write a program that uses nested while loops to print a pyramid pattern of asterisks (*).
# Steps:
# Define the height of the pyramid (number of rows) as a variable, for example: rows = 5.
# Use nested while loops to achieve the following:
# The outer loop will control the number of rows.
# The inner loop will print spaces and then asterisks in each row, creating a triangular shape.
# Remember to adjust the number of spaces and asterisks printed within the inner loop based on the current row number to form the pyramid.
row = int(input("Insert the number of row : "))
i = 0
while(row >i):
   i += 1
   print(" "*(row-i),end =" ")
   print("*"*((2*i)-1))
